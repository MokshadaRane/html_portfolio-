<h1>Best Netflix Movies</h1>
<h2>Top 3</h2>
<hr>
<h3>#1 Army of the Dead</h3>
<p>Army of the Dead was Zack Snyder’s first
     feature following his increasingly acrimonious 
     split with Warner Bros, and it’s everything 
     that his DC Extended Universe (DCEU) superhero movies 
     weren’t: bright, colorful, action-packed, funny, and topical,
      even if its 45-minute introduction is a little self-indulgent.

<h3>#2 Extraction 1 and 2</h3>
<p>Looking for an unrelenting thrill ride that's stuffed 
    with some of the best action sequences we've seen in 
    a long time? Netflix Original film series Extraction 
    is the one for you.
</p>
<h3>#3 John Wick 1,2, and 3</h3>
<p>A story that begins with Reeves’ titular assassin tracking 
    down those responsible for killing his dog (a gift from his deceased wife) 
    and his beloved Mustang, John Wick soon evolves into an engrossing, expansive 
    universe full of intriguing hitman-based mythos, betrayals, tragedy, 
    underappreciated humor, and some of the most spectacular fight scenes 
    we’ve seen in a long time.
